It also allows an agent to initiate the takeover process by providing a pause button.These two critical functionalities (monitoring and take-over) are vital for maintaining a low chatbot churn, understanding user behaviour and identifying workflows which can be improved.

On my unraid setup (using the containers listed in first post) only postgres11 stores any userdata, so I was able to wipe everything, delete all the configurations and start over. After that I saw I can just stop everything (photonix, redis & postgres) and delete postgres userdata, then start back up (postgres, redis, then photonix) and have a clean installation.The way I got everything working was I went through the photonix official  file and made sure I am using EXACTLY the same images, those being: ,  and .\nAfter that, I edited the unraid templates and tried to get everything inline with the  file.\nI also noticed that the instance refuses to work if a django secret is not set, it doesn't create one by itself as indicated. Considering so much fuss is made about known django secret keys, it seems weird that it will complain infinitely that no secret is set.Lastly, I used the default created postgres database, and I think this might also somehow be important.\nCreating a secondary database with all permissions (Using instructions in my previous comment) might well be an issue, but I haven't gone back to test this as I've been able to wipe and restart without issues. Still, would be a weird bug if that's the case that you have to dedicate an entire postgres instance or it will refuse to work as part of a shared instance.Can I ask what solution you went with in the end?\nI'm currently working through different solutions at the moment, with the intention/use-case of sharing self-hosted family photos amongst my family.",

I was just thinking a PUT request to /tags instead of /conversations/{conversation_id}/tags would make sense. Even for creation of new tags (not sure how it's done behind the scenese).When we add tags through X at the moment, if you add a bunch it seems to have a set list of a few through the spectrum but after some period of time it goes back to the start of that list, which is green I think. So if you add one every now and then it is looking like they would all be the same color anyway which feels a little like why bother. I could be wrong and that is just a coincidence though.At the moment we have a client who we are training to use X so they can add more content themselves, they are non-techinical and getting them to use an api is pretty much out.As a user myself I would see wanting an easier way to deal with tags, I think tags are a good feature and like using them, and having a personal/team color pattern for different types of tags was the first thought in my mind when adding them. I understand there is a lot going on though with the new 2.0 and get it might not be a priority or something that makes sense from the Rasa side.",

When crossing different types of lanes, the sensor will give the name of the lane crossed. Specifically, when crossing the curb line, the sensor will give the feedback signal of \"NONE\", which indicates the vehicle crossing the lane type called \"NONE\". Based on this principle, I could detect it when the ego vehicle crosses the curb line. However, in the official CARLA maps, the \"NONE\" signal occurs not only in crossing curb lines, but also in crossing some dashed white lines or dashed yellow lines. In this context, I cannot perfectly detect curb-line-crossing behaviors. Could somebody give insights on how to merely detect the curb line crossing behavior?Carla Version: 0.9.13\nPlatform: Win10",

We used the provided environment.py for changing the weather parameters.

A contributor even mentioned that opengl isn't supported anymore for the newer Carla versions.We're more than happy to provide further details, if necessary.Hoping to find a solution! Thanks!",

In comparison, the previous option will only be able to access the state of the Panel Work itself.Just a bit of orientation here, just feel free to explore, looking forward!",

We'd have to know that these pages should be loaded in the background.We don't have any way to create a simple alias for something like \"search yahoo finance for irobot\" as \"check stocks for irobot\", especially since it includes a slot.

And it doesn't run Python (without a lot of work).I think our emphasis is on routing things to web-based services. So if we could send an utterance to a MyCroft device, then that would be quite sensible. You'd need to configure your personal MyCroft device. But if MyCroft has a local web page where you can type in some text (or put it in the query string) then the configuration could be as simple as saying \"this is my MyCroft page\" with the appropriate page open.That would open a second question: which phrases do we forward to MyCroft? The easy thing is to give the device a name and require the user to say \"tell mycroft to [something]\". We could also consider a configurable fallback service (Google is essentially our fallback service), but I doubt MyCroft would be useful that way – it doesn't handle random queries particularly well. The fanciest would be for MyCroft to either publish some phrases, or dynamically tell us if it thinks it can parse a phrase well. There's some danger there in MyCroft being greedy about handling phrases, but it would be an interesting question to try to figure out.Lastly, we just take some of those skills and replicate them here. Whenever possible we'd like to forward things to a web-based service, though in some cases implementing something natively is helpful, for instance there's reasons for us to have native timers.",

I use currently for every webcam one \"WebcamStreamer\" class with port 8080 + n and switch the livestream with them. After a few minutes of inactivity, the cameras should be switched off. I use WebcamStreamer stop(). Is it possibele to restart an existing Streamer or schould a new object be created?\nI tried different combinations but at some point I can't see the livestream.\nWhat is the best way?

Every one I take a look into has some limitations you would have to w/a when you decide to use it.The Webcam Capture API does not (currently) support reading h.264. If you want to use it you need to configure your camera to serve MJPEG instead of h.264.In regards to:I'm not using Internet Explorer (because it sucks) and I would be completely astonished if they have such useful feature implemented. For the development I strongly suggest using  with  or , but please note that the last one has problems with rendering MJPEG, so I would stick to the Firefox.Android  its own codecs to read h.264 frames.

            "body": "First, let me congratulate you for your work. Your Webcam Capture library is awesome! Very effective and much more easy to use than the JMF from sun-oracle. Secondly, forgive me for my bad english, if it is. It's not my native language.\nWell, now... the issue... I'm making and application that shows the images of several webcams in a window (JFrame), and if you select one of them, it is shown in the main windows (a JFrame too). Everything was going well, the webcams was shown in the selection window, and the selected webcam was shown in the main window. But when I get to the moment of taking a picture (using the getImage() method) in the main window, the problem comes out. Every picture that I take is stored in a Vector, which is passed as the argument for a viewer window (JFame), and when I open it, it turns out that every image in the sequence of the viewer window is the same, the last one. It seems as if the last picture taken replaces the earlier ones in the vector.\nBut there's more. Whenever I clik a button in the viewer window, the webcam takes a snapshot and replaces the central image of the viewer panel (the bigger one) with the new one.So we have two issues in here:I would be very thankful if help me out with this. You'll see, this is part of my thesis, and if you take some time for helping out to solve this issues I would really appreciate it.I'm going to show you the relevant parts of my code so you can understand the way I'm doing the things.For detecting the several webcams connected I use the following code:In the selection window, the several webcams are showing through a square that extends from JToggleButton. This is the constructor for the squares:Now, once I do click over any square, the image appears immediately in the main window, with a bigger size. The main window implements the ActionListener interface, and this is the relevant part of the actionPerformed method:Well, as I told you before, I would be very grateful if you help me solve this problems.\nThanks in advanced.\nAH!... And my OS is Windows 7 (32-bit), and I'm usin webcam-capture-0.3.10-RC6-dist. My webcmas are Genius ISlim 300X.",

On Linux or Mac OS you will simply get an error.Just wanted to explain this - opening single webcam in parallel is fundamentally wrong and you should avoid this. If you want more details I can explain you later because now I have to catch the last bus to my apartment or I will have to go 13 km by foot at night.In regards to the image replacement - I guess this may be caused by the fact you are using non-blocking mode where image is buffered (open method with arg true), but I have to verify this. Try opening webcam with open(false) and check again. Seems like the images are not really replaced, but by the fact that you are always getting the same image. Please correct me if I'm wrong.",

But as I told you... the problem regards the getImage() method persists.\nWhat about if we do this... for you must be very easy and quick to make... Create a WebcamPanel in the usual way, creating its Webcam as you always do, and try this: get several images using the getImage() method and store them in a Vector at the same time you are getting them, one by one. Then, use the vector to display the images in a diferente window, and you'll see that they all will be the same.\nAnd don't forget the most weird issue... when I press any button in the viewer panel, which has nothing to do with the main window, where the getImage() method stays, all images change into a new captured image. As if the webcam took an snapshot alone, just by pressing any button. I could think in a logic error if it happened in the main window, where the getImage() method stays, but, in the viewer panel?... Why? I don't understand.I hope you don't bother for helping me out. Your library is very good, and I'd like to use it properly.\nThanks in advanced, sarxos.",

It's pretty weird since  does not expose any camera controls for mouse or keyboard - it's just a plain area where image is being drawn. I suppose this may be side effect of the bug, so please try with new JAR.As for the parallel playing, I haven't said it's not possible - you can of course play image from one webcam in unlimited number of panels (as long as you have resources for that), but you  open it twice (the webcam device). This is because when you open camera, it allocates native instance which is using DirectShow on Windows, libv4l on Linux and QuickTime on Mac. The problem arose because Windows allows two separate instances to use the same camera device (Linux and Mac does not allow such operation) via the same capture graph, and when you close one instance, it will destroy capture graph, so when second instance will try to read it, it will most likely crash because of segmentation fault, or with some strange error in console (if you are lucky enough).Here is the small program I used to debug the problem (as you suggested).

After I fixed the bug, the same code confirmed it does not persist any more.Have you removed previous Webcam Capture JAR from classpath and replaced by new one, or you just added new one without removing previous?

Maven takes this burden from you and create dependency tree which contains all required JARs and download them from the  which contains more than half million of officially released files. It knowns what JARs are required by other JARs because their creators declared this when they put them in Maven Central.Learning Maven may be a little hard for the beginning, but after you are familiar with this tool, it's like a blessing in your everyday programming life.

Without this code you would not have ability to save images into files.And in regards to:No. The  and  works in a different for IP cameras when you compare to  webcam.In case of classic webcam (the ) when you invoke  then hardware device is turned on (LED is powered) and USB capacity is allocated to stream image frames. After you invoke  the USB capacity is released and UVC device is turned off. There is a direct connection between UVC being turned on/off and the webcam state (unless something is broken).The  from the other hand is always turned on, unless you turn it off with a manual switch, a power cord or administration panel. In this case when you invoke  a persistent HTTP connection is made which is used to stream MJPEG frames from camera to your computer, but this is done with the IP/TCP instead of USB (as in case of UVC). Then, when you invoke , the webcam is not turned off, but the HTTP connection is closed instead and IP camera device remains active.This is a difference.

The code I initially wrote was to support multiple cameras, but finally I left only one IP camera in the code.You have to use composite driver to \"compose\" two drivers into one, example:You set it in the same way as you would do it with a different drivers:You can access cameras by index so the ones from first driver will be first one the list (e.g. index 0), and the ones from second driver will be added later (e.g. index 1, 2, 3, etc).The other option is to use camera names, but this may be tricky on Windows since it may work well on your computer, but different computers may have different camera names.

After an image is loaded every action (hovering over UI elements, padding or zooming the image, editing or creating a new annotation) is delayed by 2-5 seconds.After detecting a drop in responsiveness (long image load time, a large number of annotations, or the time it takes to perform certain actions) present a user with a way of increasing responsiveness by allowing the user to choose a smaller part of an image that he currently wants to work on which could work as follows:I'm trying to annotate stars on photos made by astronomic telescopes that are usually large files with thousands of visible stars.I'm using the cvat.org with Brave browser.\nGPU: AMD Radeon 5700 XT\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 3600\nRAM: 16GBI assumed that hosting CVAT locally would not provide any improvement however, let me know if I'm wrong.",

This initial request can take 30+ seconds to resolve. Then, a network request is made to fetch the thumbnail for each task. This is on reasonably fast host with plenty of CPU/memory.I would expect the project details page to only fetch a subset of tasks and provide a pagination mechanism.The project details page fetches all tasks in the initial project request. It seems all tasks are fetched from the DB, serialized, and returned in the response body.Paginating the task list the same way the  page is paginated would likely solve this problem. It may make sense to fetch the task list in a separate XHR request which can be paginated independently from the project request, using the  API endpoint, such as .We use a small number of projects so that we can share label specs across a large number of related tasks. Without the shared project labels, it is extremely difficult to keep label specs in sync across tasks. Because of this, the project details page is usually the starting point for accessing task lists.If there were an easier mechanism for sharing label specs across tasks then the project details page would be less important.",

This is especially annoying if the Naomi is processing audio that turns out not to be a command while you are trying to get it to do something. I find that figuring out when I can start speaking to Naomi requires visual feedback.Currently, Naomi runs on a loop. Listen for speech, use the passive stt engine to check for the presence of a wake word, use the active stt engine to verify the presence of the wake word and extract command audio, use the tti engine to identify the intent, use the intent to activate the correct speech handler, then add the audio output from the handler to the speech queue, and finally return to listening. Any sounds directed to Naomi during the processing are never recorded. This would allow Naomi to \"cache\" audio that is being spoken while Naomi is processing audio so it can be processed later.We should be able to create a separate listener thread that uses the vad.get_audio() method to push blocks of audio into a queue for sequential processing in the main loop, or just a listening thread that puts all audio blocks into a queue that vad.get_audio() would read from. The passive listening engines seem to be fast enough that it shouldn't slow down response time too much if Naomi is still checking an earlier audio block for a wake word when you start speaking. We shall see.We also need some way of clearing the buffer, so that when the 'expect()' or 'confirm()' functions are used the stream can be reset as Naomi starts asking the question. Otherwise, it will quite likely accept some sound made prior to the question will be accepted as the response. Simply clearing the buffer every time Naomi starts speaking would probably work well enough for now. We also need to be able to \"pause\" the buffering for users who don't have the ability to cancel audio output from the audio input stream.",

            "body": "Hey Peter. That's a good question. There is a sort of answer here:  with regard to adding Esperanto specifically, although nobody has yet gone through the whole process of adding a whole new language.As far as changes to the core naomi code, you would have to add your language as an option to the get_language method in naomi/commandline.py (this really isn't the right place for this function, so I imagine it will move eventually, and it should also be modified to key off of the list of .po files in naomi/data/locale instead of a hard-coded list) if you want people to be able to select it during the initial configuration (once a language is selected, Naomi should switch to communicating in that language, but the translation files for French and German currently need to be updated - see pull request ).The process of adding a new language could be broken down into three projects: STT (speech to text), TTI (text to intent), and TTS (text to speech).With Speech to Text, you first have to decide what engine you want to work with. Pocketsphinx and Deepspeech are both good choices for a more or less complete solution, and Kaldi is good for a solution once you are more comfortable with the concepts used in STT. They all have tutorials where building a new speech recognition model is discussed:Speech to text is generally broken down into three main concepts of acoustic model, phoneme to grapheme, and language model. The language model flows directly into the next project, Text to Intent, since it is using expectations to determine what it most likely heard.For Text to intent, you currently have to modify the intents() methods in each of the speechhandler plugins, and also generate new .po gettext translation files for the core and plugins.The intents() methods return a list of things the user might say to activate the plugin, which then get fed into whichever Text to Intent plugin you are using. Since there are different numbers of ways to say things in different languages, it just didn't work to use literal translations here. This gives an intent author better control of how an intent is constructed in a specific language, but does require someone who is adding a new language to do a lot more work, and modify every speechhandler plugin. There are instructions for writing intents here: I have considered defining a JSON format file for holding intents, so that someone adding a new translation would be adding new files, not modifying the intents() method of the plugin itself. One benefit of using that kind of file structure is that it could provide a fairly easy method of identifying plugins in the Naomi Plugin Exchange by the locales they are configured to work with, and possibly even allow people to attach additional translations to remotely hosted plugins without having to modify the plugin itself. Currently there is no indication on the Naomi Plugin Exchange of which languages a plugin supports.Generating the .po files is simply a matter of running the \"update_languages.sh -l <locale_identifier>\" with the locale identifier. If there is no locale identifier for the language you want to add, you can just make it up. It only has to be consistent within Naomi. This generates a bunch of files called <local_identifier>.po. Unfortunately, you have to go in and manually translate all the phrases in those .po files. This allows Naomi to translate its responses into another language to either display on the screen or say to the user.Last, you need Naomi to be able to say the response, so you need a Text to Speech system which is trained to speak your language so is able to pronounce the words being fed to it. If you have a mismatch between the locale and the voice, it can be difficult to understand (as an analog, I have been told by a Swiss friend that pronouncing Maori words correctly is much easier if you try to pronounce them in German than in English). Voice building can be a pretty complex task. Here are instructions for building a new voice for the Mary TTS system:  and Festival: So it is certainly not easy, but it can be done. If someone would be interested in doing this and documenting their progress, I think that would be incredibly helpful to others. The whole process is a lot easier if you can find a ready made STT model and TTS voice. If you are generating a new language from scratch then you will need a lot of labeled recordings. Naomi is able to help with that, especially if you can find a cloud provider that already provides STT and TTS in the target language. Then, once you have customized the intents and built translation files, you could use Naomi normally with audiolog enabled to build up a collection of labeled samples which could be used to build both the STT models and TTS voice.Please let me know if you have more questions or if you see any mistakes above. I hope that's helpful and not overly dense. I could go into a lot more detail, and would be willing to work directly with someone attempting to do this, especially if they would be willing to help document the process. Do you have a specific use case in mind?",

A possible use case would have been to add Maori as a language.\nBTW What do you think of meta-STT and meta-TTS wrappers?\nFor example, you could take the output of your base STT and push that through Google translate (from Maori to English) to avoid having to update all your plugins for handling this language. Any English text that would have to be spoken could be translated again, e.g., through Google translate again, before pushing it out through a Maori TTS. I could imagine that this kind of translation approach might work relatively well, as long as the incoming and outgoing text is relatively simple and short.",

My experience with google translate is that it works well enough to get the intent across, but rarely beyond pidgin level language.My biggest concern is with regard to 3rd party speechhandler plugins. I'd like to have an easy way for someone to add a translation \"pack\" to some else's plugin consisting of a .po translation file and an intent file, and for another user to then download the plugin with the added translation files.I have thought about expanding the \"update_translations.py\" program to use Google translate to generate the translation files, which should work fine in our current state without leaking usage data to Google. That way a user could generate all the translation files needed for their whole system to get Naomi up and running in a new language quickly and later go and fix the translations.For the time being, I see Naomi as more of a development kit than a finished product. My hope is that through being able to experiment with different technologies, we will eventually be able to come up with an effective platform that runs locally rather than in the cloud. Once something really seems to be working, Naomi could be used as a template to write a system optimized for the specific plugins.Have you ever used a piece of software called Simon ()? It used to be part of the KDE desktop, but the lead developer went to work for Apple's Siri division a few years ago and the project sort of fell apart after that. The idea was to have a simple means of controlling the desktop using voice, sort of like the scene in Bladerunner where Harrison Ford is zooming in on an image on his computer. One thing it included was the ability to train STT systems, especially the Julius STT engine. One of my visions for Naomi is to provide that same ability to train speech recognition engines which can then be re-applied to your own projects.You would still need both Speech to Text and Text to Speech systems with acoustic models optimized for the specific language, which I consider to be the most difficult part. Doing the actual translations is pretty straightforward.",

This is kind of a big question, and given that Naomi uses plugins, it's impossible to give a specific set of instructions that cover every use case. At the same time, there are some definite steps that would always have to be done that can be documented along with some vague information about generating new STT and TTS models for those who need to. I'm just not sure how to resolve this.",

Definitely keep me informed.What I have learned from working with Naomi, though, is that you don't need perfect recognition to get good comprehension at the intent level, especially if you are willing to accept a pretty simple model where only one intent is triggered at a time.Adding some humorous responses can be a good strategy for generating some good will with users and keeping them engaged when the computer is having some trouble understanding them, as long as they don't happen too often.The point is that speech recognition will never be perfect, since even you are processing language at multiple levels to make sense of it. I have some hearing loss, so often what I actually hear is garbled, but I can usually work out the speaker's intent from context.A good illustration of the process of of the process our brains engage in for listening would be the \"Mares eat oats\" song which can sound like gibberish until you get to the \"wouldn't you?\" part of the song and realize that the whole thing has been in english the whole time.Since I started verifying/correcting transcriptions with the NaomiSTTTrainer.py software, I have gained a lot of understanding of how exactly the computer hears things and the process of matching the sounds up with a meaningful sentence. Often a little nudging in the language model is enough to get much better comprehension, and that is why edit distances and soundex type matching can be a huge help when dealing with spoken language.",

However, siri \"wake word\" recognition  is more effective and accurate. If you are able to make Athena's wake word detection to be more accurate and faster (better mic and more efficient code) then you can skip the double beep with ease. Otherwise, you won't know when Athena is responding and when she isn't.",
